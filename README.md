# Hi, I'm Favour 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

<!-- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0nica/M0nica/master/gh-header-image-cropped.png" alt="banner that says Favour Ezeugwa - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica"> -->
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about building websites and web apps, making contributions to open-source, and public speaking. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap.
<!-- In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.reactrobins.com/">React Robins</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers. -->
